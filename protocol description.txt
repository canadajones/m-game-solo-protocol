This device communicates over MIDI, using System Exclusive messages to send commands back and forth. 

SysEx - commands start with data bytes 


00 01 05 43 00
00    - extended manufacturer ID will follow
01 05 - Manufacturer ID for M-Audio
43 - Device ID
00 - Status - 00 for success, 7F for error


The remaining bytes are described in this document.



01 0A 00 01 00 35 00 00 00 76
B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9

B3 is command type

B0 indicates message length. For now, every known length value is specified in compose.py.

1) Patching inputs and outputs - B3 = 0

This device supports patching any input to any output. There are 6 inputs, and 6 outputs. Inputs and outputs are labelled relative to the device (i.e. an input is audio going into the interface)

Inputs              ID
    Microphone:     0x00
    Game:           0x02  # from PC
    Chat In:        0x04  # from PC
    Auxiliary:      0x06
    Sampler:        0x08  # from PC
    System:         0x0A  # from PC

Outputs             ID
    Stream:         0x00  # to PC
    Chat Out:       0x01  # to pc
    Auxiliary USB:  0x02  # to PC
    Sampler:        0x03  # to PC
    Main Out:       0x04
    Phones Out:     0x05

The microphone source comes from the microphone jack/XLR input, while the auxiliary input comes from either the optical in or the 3.5 mm input jack (configurable in the OEM software)
The main out and phones out outputs go to the corresponding output jacks on the back of the device.


2) Sliders/sink volume changes - B3 = 1

All math is done in 8 bit two's complement, then the result's highest bit is set to 0.
Each slider corresponds to a source, except for the rightmost slider, which corresponds to two virtual sources. The microphone slider c

01 02 00 01 44 00 00 00 00 6F 
01 02 01 01 44 00 00 00 00 6E

01 02 05 01 44 00 00 00 00 6A
B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9

b1 is source ID

b2 is sink ID

B4 is sometimes 00, sometimes 0x44

B5:
    Volume value. For B4 = 0, this is the raw linear slider position encoded from 00 = bottom, 7F = top, with some deadzone at the very ends.
                  For B4 = 0x44
B5 - B8:
    Unused for sliders, not guaranteed to be 0 in all message types

B9 is checksum value. Summing all values (including the ones in sysex prologue) including this one will produce 0 mod 128.

Each move of a slider sends a series of messages.
The first message has B4 = 0, and reports the position of the slider corresponding to the given sink. The next 6 messages reports the volume settings of each of the 6 sinks. This volume is non-linear, and has yet to be summarised.Â¨



Buttons - B3 = 2
