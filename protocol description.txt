SysEx - commands start with data bytes 
00 01 05 43 00
00    - extended manufacturer ID will follow
01 05 - Manufacturer ID for M-Audio
43 - Device ID, most likely
00 - Status - 00 for success, 7F for error


The remaining bytes are described in this document.

01 0A 00 01 00 35 00 00 00 76
B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9

B3 is command type

B0 indicates message length:
    B0 = 01 -> message is 15 bytes long
    B0 = 02 -> message is 19 bytes long

1) Sliders - B3 = 1

Assuming slider value (SV henceforth) is an unsigned number from 0 to 7F describing slider position, where 0 is bottom and 7F is top
All math is done in 8 bit two's complement, then the result's highest bit is set to 0.

B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9

b1 is source ID

b2 is sink ID

B4 is sometimes 00, sometimes 44

B5:
    if SV  = 0, B5 is 0
    if SV != 0, B5 = slider value + B4

B6-B8 is padding 0

B9 is checksum value. Summing all values (including the ones in sysex prologue) including this one will produce 0 mod 128.

Each move of a slider sends a series of messages. These sequences may be stitched together as such:

First, one message is sent where B2 and B4 is 0.

Thereafter, a number of messages are sent, where the following rules apply:
    For each B1 value, there is one or zero messages sent with each B2 value less than 5, and where B4 is 44.
    When interpreting, the messages should be grouped by B1, then sorted by ascending B2
    The messages are sent in ascending B2 order. 
    Each slider modification started by a B1 and B2 combo is terminated with a B2 = 5.



Buttons - B3 = 2







Patching.
This device supports patching any input to any output. There are 6 inputs, and 6 outputs.
